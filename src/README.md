# src directory tree
#
# This directory contains the source code of the game.
# It is organized in a tree-like structure, with each subdirectory representing a different module or part of the game.
#
# The code in this directory is organized in the following way:
#
# - `main.cpp`: The main entry point of the program. It initializes the game, creates the window and runs the game loop.
# - `shapes.cpp`: Functions to draw shapes, such as circles, rectangles, and lines.
# - `game.cpp`: Functions to update and render the game.
# - `graphics.cpp`: Functions to initialize and manage the graphics context.
# - `input.cpp`: Functions to handle user input.
# - `util.cpp`: Utility functions, such as error handling and file loading.
#
# Note: This is just a basic structure, and the actual organization may change as the project evolves.
